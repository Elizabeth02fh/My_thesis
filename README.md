This is my thesis project to obtain a degree in Systems Engineering, entitled Predictive Model of lifestyles for university students based on Machine Learning techniques.
Below I will present the summary of this project in broad strokes:
## Context ##
Predict the lifestyles adopted by university students with the model
predictive based on Machine Learning Techniques. The research hypothesized: The
predictive model based on Machine Learning Techniques allows predicting lifestyles
adopted by college students. A population of 2031 has been considered
students, for which a sample of 323 students was taken, the data collection instrument
data used was the survey.

The stages that include are:
1. Data Collection
2. Selection, Cleaning and
Transformation
3. Generation of the predictive model
4. Interpretation and evaluation.

In the first stage, records collected through a survey of students were collected.
university students In the second stage, the data pre-processing, data balancing
and feature selection. In the third stage, the supervised algorithms of
Machine Learning to create the predictive model. In the fourth stage, they were interpreted and
evaluated the results of the evaluation metrics generated by the SVM algorithms,
KNN and Decision Trees.
